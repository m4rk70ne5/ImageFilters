For Better Design Next Time:
  - Make sure the App is a singleton
  - Make sure individual objects store program IDs rather than program strings
  - Make a better key handling mechanism
  - The Screen was basically the App -- combine them into one next time
  - Use uniform blocks
  - Have the Program Manager work with shader related tasks (e.g., setting uniforms)
  - Delegate more computation load to the shader (pass it keypress info)

Specific to this Image Filters app:
  - Have the blur and sharpening filters to separate programs
  - The blur filter should blur according to radius
