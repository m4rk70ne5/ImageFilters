1) figure out what texture coordinates to pass into the vertex shader
   a) once the coordinates are in the vertex shader, figure out what to do with it

----

1) Register key inputs
2) The + and - keys will raise/lower the scale factor uniform of kernel image
   - implement scale factor in fragment shader

----

Make sure everything is cleaned up!
